-- Demo queries: health checks, feature previews, and barâ†”trade alignment.

-- 1) Quick health checks
SELECT * FROM symbols;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS n_bars   FROM bars;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS n_trades FROM trades;

-- 2) Peek first few bars per symbol (chronological)
SELECT symbol_id, ts, open, high, low, close, volume
FROM bars
ORDER BY symbol_id, ts
LIMIT 10;

-- 3) Returns + RSI from the view
SELECT symbol_id, ts, r_1m, rsi_14
FROM features__returns_rsi
WHERE symbol_id = 1
ORDER BY ts
LIMIT 10;

-- 4) VWAP + volume z-score from the trades view
SELECT symbol_id, ts, vwap_30m, z_vol_30m
FROM features__vwap_volume_z
WHERE symbol_id = 2
ORDER BY ts
LIMIT 10;

-- 5) Align trade-time features to the bar grid (nearest trade <= bar ts)
-- Portable pattern (no IGNORE NULLS): rank trades up to the bar and pick rn=1.
